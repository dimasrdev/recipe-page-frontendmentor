### What I learned

It's been a while since I've code something. I mostly just do FreeCodeCamp training now. I still don't know how to be a "real" developer. But, I'm proud to say that at least I am still able to code some HTML along with Tailwind CSS. I hope I will be a developer one day. Cheers to those who dared to dream!
